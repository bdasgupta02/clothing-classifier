# Clothing/fashion classifier
### A classifier model based on VGG19 that identifies the type of clothing through an image

Uploading this repo because I did not find much sample code for high-resolution clothing classifiers. 

Uses the dataset which can be found [at this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/agrigorev/clothing-dataset-full)
